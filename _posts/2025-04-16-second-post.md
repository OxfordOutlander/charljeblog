Tags are an excellent way to organize your Jekyll blog content. Unlike categories, tags are more flexible and can be applied more liberally to group related content.

## How Tags Work in Jekyll

Jekyll automatically creates collections of posts based on their tags. You can use Liquid templates to access these collections and create tag-based archives.

## Benefits of Using Tags

- **Improved Navigation**: Help readers find related content
- **Better SEO**: Tags can improve search engine optimization
- **Content Organization**: Group similar topics together
- **Reader Experience**: Allow readers to browse topics they're interested in

To add tags to a post, simply include them in the front matter as we've done with this post.
