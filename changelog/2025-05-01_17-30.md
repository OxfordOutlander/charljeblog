## Theme System Temporary Disable

### Changes Made
1. Removed Themes navigation link from header
   - Modified: `_layouts/default.html`
   - Removed: `<li><a href="{{ "/themes/" | relative_url }}">Themes</a></li>`

2. Hidden theme display in posts
   - Modified: `_layouts/post.html`
   - Commented out the entire theme display section in post headers using Liquid comments

3. Disabled theme page generation
   - Modified: `_plugins/tag_generator.rb`
   - Commented out the entire TagPageGenerator and TagPage classes using Ruby's =begin/=end syntax
   - Left the FootnoteFilter module active as it's still needed for other functionality

### How to Reverse These Changes

To re-enable the theme system, follow these steps:

1. In `_layouts/default.html`:
   ```html
   <nav>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="{{ "/" | relative_url }}">Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="{{ "/themes/" | relative_url }}">Themes</a></li>
       <li><a href="{{ "/about/" | relative_url }}">About</a></li>
     </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

2. In `_layouts/post.html`:
   - Remove the `{% comment %}` and `{% endcomment %}` tags around the theme display section

3. In `_plugins/tag_generator.rb`:
   - Remove the `=begin` and `=end` markers to re-enable the tag generator plugin

After making these changes, rebuild the site to regenerate all theme pages and restore full theme functionality.

### Technical Notes
- The theme data is still preserved in post front matter for future use
- No theme-related files were deleted, only disabled
- The theme system can be re-enabled without any data loss 

### Additional Notes
1. Theme-related files that still exist but are inactive:
   - `themes.html` (main themes page)
   - `_layouts/tag.html` (individual theme page template)
   - `assets/js/theme-filter.js` and `assets/js/tag-filter.js`
   These files can remain in place as they won't affect the site while the theme system is disabled.

2. Rebuild Instructions
   After re-enabling themes, run:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll clean   # Clear out any cached theme pages
   bundle exec jekyll build   # Rebuild the site with themes enabled
   ```

3. Verification Steps
   After re-enabling, verify:
   - Theme links appear in navigation
   - Theme pages are generated in the `_site` directory
   - Individual posts show their themes
   - Theme filtering functionality works
