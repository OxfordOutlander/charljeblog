      - Installation and setup instructions
      - Content management guidelines
      - Customization options
      - Deployment instructions

### Technical Decisions

1. **Ruby Environment**
   - Chose to use Homebrew Ruby over system Ruby for better compatibility
   - Used Bundler with vendor/bundle path to avoid permission issues

2. **Tag Implementation**
   - Selected custom plugin approach over collection-based approach for better flexibility
   - Used Liquid templating for tag displays to ensure compatibility

3. **CSS Structure**
   - Used single CSS file instead of Sass partials for simplicity
   - Implemented clean, readable class naming convention

4. **JavaScript Implementation**
   - Used vanilla JS for scroll effects to avoid dependencies
   - Implemented event delegation pattern for performance

### Lessons Learned

1. **Ruby Environment Management**
   - macOS system Ruby has permission restrictions requiring careful gem installation
   - Using Bundler with local vendor path avoids permission issues

2. **Jekyll Configuration**
   - Jekyll plugin development requires careful attention to Ruby class structure
   - Tag implementation benefits from custom plugin approach

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Server port conflicts can occur when Jekyll instances aren't properly terminated
   - Clean builds help resolve caching issues with plugins

### Next Steps

1. **SEO Optimization**
   - Configure meta tags for improved search indexing
   - Add sitemap.xml

2. **Social Sharing**
   - Implement Open Graph and Twitter card meta tags
   - Add social sharing buttons to posts

3. **Comments System**
   - Integrate Disqus or similar commenting system

4. **Analytics**
   - Add Google Analytics or similar tracking

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Configure custom domain if needed
